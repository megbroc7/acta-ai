# Acta AI Application Fixes

This document outlines the issues identified in the Acta AI application and the fixes applied to resolve them.

## Issues Identified

1. **Database Initialization Issue**: The application doesn't create an admin user during initialization, which means no one can log in.

2. **Environment Configuration Issue**: The backend `.env` file has `localhost` in the `DATABASE_URL` instead of `db` which is the Docker service name.

3. **Frontend API URL Issue**: The frontend is configured to use a specific IP address for the API, which can cause issues if the IP changes or when accessing from different networks.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Admin User Creation Script**: Created a script (`create_admin.py`) to add an admin user to the database.

2. **Database Initialization Update**: Modified `init_db.py` to automatically create an admin user during database initialization.

3. **Frontend Environment Update**: Updated the frontend `.env` file to use a relative URL for the API, which makes it more portable.

4. **Deployment Script**: Created a deployment script (`deploy_fixed.sh`) that rebuilds and restarts the application with all the fixes applied.

## How to Deploy the Fixed Application

1. Run the fixed deployment script:

```bash
./deploy_fixed.sh
```

This script will:
- Stop and remove existing containers
- Rebuild all containers with the fixes
- Start the containers
- Create an admin user

2. Access the application at: http://24.144.116.59:3000/login

3. Log in with the following credentials:
   - Email: admin@example.com
   - Password: adminpassword

## Manual Fix (if needed)

If you need to create an admin user manually, you can run:

```bash
./run_admin_creation.sh
```

This will create an admin user with the same credentials mentioned above.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the logs of the containers:

```bash
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
docker-compose logs db
```

2. Ensure the database is properly initialized:

```bash
docker exec -it acta-ai-db-1 psql -U postgres -d actaai -c "SELECT * FROM users;"
```

3. Verify the environment variables are correctly set:

```bash
docker exec -it acta-ai-backend-1 env | grep DATABASE_URL
docker exec -it acta-ai-frontend-1 env | grep REACT_APP_API_URL
```
