# Dependency Vulnerability Scan + Triage (2026-02-20)

Scope:
- Backend Python dependencies (`backend/requirements.txt`)
- Frontend React app (`frontend/package-lock.json`)
- Shopify app (`shopify-app/acta-blog-publisher/package-lock.json`)

Scan artifacts:
- `backend/docs/security/pip-audit-backend-2026-02-20.json`
- `backend/docs/security/pip-audit-backend-2026-02-20-after-fixes.json`
- `backend/docs/security/npm-audit-frontend-2026-02-20.json`
- `backend/docs/security/npm-audit-frontend-prodonly-2026-02-20.json`
- `backend/docs/security/npm-audit-shopify-app-2026-02-20.json`
- `backend/docs/security/npm-audit-shopify-app-prodonly-2026-02-20.json`

## 1. Executive Summary

- Backend: started with **11 vulnerabilities in 5 packages**, reduced to **3 vulnerabilities in 2 packages** after dependency upgrades.
- Frontend: **7 vulnerabilities (4 high)** in full audit, but **0 vulnerabilities** in production-only (`--omit=dev`) audit.
- Shopify app: **38 vulnerabilities (20 high)** in full audit, and **12 vulnerabilities (6 high)** still present in production-only audit.

## 2. Backend Remediation Applied

Updated `backend/requirements.txt`:
- `python-jose[cryptography]` from `3.3.0` -> `3.4.0`
- `python-multipart` from `0.0.12` -> `0.0.22`
- `cryptography` from `43.0.1` -> `46.0.5`

Validation:
- Backend tests: `35 passed` after upgrades.

## 3. Triage Disposition

### 3.1 Backend (Remaining 3)

1. `starlette` (`CVE-2024-47874`, `CVE-2025-54121`)
- Severity context: DoS risk tied to multipart/form parsing behavior.
- Status: **Deferred (requires framework upgrade)**.
- Why deferred: Current `fastapi==0.115.0` pins Starlette `<0.39.0`; fixed Starlette versions are `>=0.40.0` and `>=0.47.2`, requiring FastAPI stack upgrade and regression pass.
- Compensating controls:
  - Edge protections already in place/added at nginx layer.
  - No known high-volume multipart upload path in current core flows.
- Action: Plan a controlled FastAPI/Starlette upgrade work item in Week 2/3 with full regression testing.

2. `ecdsa` (`CVE-2024-23342`)
- Severity context: timing side-channel in specific ECDSA signing scenarios; no upstream fix published.
- Status: **Accepted with constraints**.
- Why accepted: App token flow uses `HS256` JWT signing, not ECDSA signing operations.
- Action: Keep under periodic review; consider moving to libraries/minimal crypto surface that exclude unused ECDSA paths.

### 3.2 Frontend App

1. Full audit result: 7 vulnerabilities (eslint/minimatch/ajv toolchain).
- Status: **Accepted (dev-tooling only)**.
- Evidence: Production-only scan (`npm audit --omit=dev`) returned `0`.
- Rationale: Affected packages are lint/build-time dependencies and not served in the runtime nginx static bundle.

### 3.3 Shopify App

1. Full audit: 38 vulnerabilities (20 high).
2. Production-only audit: 12 vulnerabilities (6 high), mostly through `@remix-run/dev` dependency chain.
- Status: **Action required (high)**.
- Rationale: Vulnerabilities remain in prod-only scan, so these are not purely dev-only findings.
- Action plan:
  - Upgrade Remix/Shopify app dependency chain to versions that resolve `minimatch/glob/tar/esbuild` advisories where available.
  - Re-evaluate dependency classification (`dependencies` vs `devDependencies`) for build-only packages.
  - Re-run `npm audit --omit=dev` until high findings are eliminated or explicitly risk-accepted with compensating controls.

## 4. Week 1 Checklist Mapping

Checklist item:
- `Run dependency vulnerability scan and triage all findings.`

Completion state:
- **Scan complete** with persisted JSON evidence.
- **Triage complete** with package-by-package disposition and remediation actions.
- **Partial remediation complete** on backend (reduced 11 -> 3 findings).
- **Remaining blocker**: Shopify app production dependency findings (12 remaining, 6 high).
