This missing validation allows an attacker to provide a public key point `P` from a small-order subgroup.  This can lead to security issues in various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA) and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as `S = [victim_private_key]P` via ECDH,  this leaks information about `victim_private_key mod (small_subgroup_order)`. For curves with cofactor > 1, this reveals the least significant bits of the private key.  When these weak public keys are used in ECDSA , it's easy to forge signatures on the small subgroup.  Only SECT curves are impacted by this.  ## Credit  This vulnerability was discovered by: - XlabAI Team of Tencent Xuanwu Lab - Atuin Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine"}]}, {"name": "pytest", "version": "8.3.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest-asyncio", "version": "0.24.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "openai", "version": "1.109.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "anyio", "version": "4.12.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "beautifulsoup4", "version": "4.14.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "distro", "version": "1.9.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httpcore", "version": "1.0.9", "vulns": []}, {"name": "jiter", "version": "0.13.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pluggy", "version": "1.6.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic", "version": "2.12.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic-core", "version": "2.41.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "six", "version": "1.17.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "starlette", "version": "0.38.6", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2024-47874", "fix_versions": ["0.40.0"], "aliases": ["GHSA-f96h-pmfr-66vw"], "description": "### Summary Starlette treats `multipart/form-data` parts without a `filename` as text form fields and buffers those in byte strings with no size limit. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary large form fields and cause Starlette to both slow down significantly due to excessive memory allocations and copy operations, and also consume more and more memory until the server starts swapping and grinds to a halt, or the OS terminates the server process with an OOM error. Uploading multiple such requests in parallel may be enough to render a service practically unusable, even if reasonable request size limits are enforced by a reverse proxy in front of Starlette.  ### PoC  ```python from starlette.applications import Starlette from starlette.routing import Route  async def poc(request):     async with request.form():         pass  app = Starlette(routes=[     Route('/', poc, methods=[\"POST\"]), ]) ```  ```sh curl http://localhost:8000 -F 'big=</dev/urandom' ```  ### Impact This Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability affects all applications built with Starlette (or FastAPI) accepting form requests.

In summary the following UploadFile code (copied from [here](https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/fa5355442753f794965ae1af0f87f9fec1b9a3de/starlette/datastructures.py#L436C5-L447C14)) has a minor bug. Instead of just checking for `self._in_memory` we should also check if the additional bytes will cause a rollover.  ```python      @property     def _in_memory(self) -> bool:         # check for SpooledTemporaryFile._rolled         rolled_to_disk = getattr(self.file, \"_rolled\", True)         return not rolled_to_disk      async def write(self, data: bytes) -> None:         if self.size is not None:             self.size += len(data)          if self._in_memory:             self.file.write(data)         else:             await run_in_threadpool(self.file.write, data) ```  I have already created a PR which fixes the problem: https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/2962   ### PoC See the discussion [here](https://github.com/encode/starlette/discussions/2927#discussioncomment-13721403) for steps on how to reproduce.  ### Impact To be honest, very low and not many users will be impacted. Parsing large forms is already CPU intensive so the additional IO block doesn't slow down `starlette` that much on systems with modern HDDs/SSDs.
